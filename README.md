# Drippie UI

## Project Overview

Drippie UI is a user interface designed to interact with the Drippie Ethereum smart contract. Drippie allows users to configure and trigger actions based on specific preconditions, managing these configurations through a process known as "dripping." This system is primarily used to manage Ethereum account balances safely, reducing the risk of large balance thefts due to account compromises.
